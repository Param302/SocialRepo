## Social links data

We need all major social media profile URLs and their respective icons.

-   All the social media media profile URLs should be stored in [`social-links.json`](../../src/social-links.json) file.
    **Preview**:
    ```json
    {
        "social_media_name": "link",
        "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/<username>",
        "github": "https://www.github.com/<username>",
        "medium": "https://<username>.medium.com"
    }
    ```
    -   The `<username>` will be replaced by the user's social media handle.
-   After adding the social media profile URL, please update the [social-apps.md](./social-apps.md) file.
    **Example**:
    If you have added the `twitter` social media profile URL, then:
    -   add `x` inside the brackets of `- [ ] Twitter`.
        _If the `twitter` social media profile name is **not** present in the list, then:_
    -   Add `- [x] Twitter` in the list.
-   All the icons should be stored in [`logos`](../../src/assets/logos/) folder.
-   Icons should be of minimum `128x128` and maximum `256x256` resolution.
-   Icons must be in `png` format and transparent background.
-   Icons should be named as `social-media-name.png` (e.g. `twitter.png`, `github.png`, `instagram.png`, etc...).
